# Rigidbody-FPS-Controller

Fast rigid body controller to help prototypes for fast development and purely to save time. This package can be easily expanded if you ever want to add crouching, wall-running, etc. This also uses cinemachine to make the controller more dynamic and alive. 

**Features:**
+ Running
+ Jumping
+ Ground check

**Custom Knockbacks** for effects if you ever want to add "recoil" to your character like an explosion. Customizable to your will.
